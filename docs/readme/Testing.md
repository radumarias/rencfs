# Testing

We'd appreciate it if you could help test the app. For now, the filesystem mounting works only on Linux, so the cleanest way is to test on Linux.

Here are some ways you can do it.

## Testing in the browser or local VSCode

You'll need a GitHub account for this.

This will create a Codespace instance on GitHub, which is a Linux container, so we will be able to test it.  
The instance config is 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM. You have 120 CPU hours per month free for Codespace, which means 60 hours for that instance. We will connect to it from the browser and the local VSCode.

### First setup

1. Open the [repo](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs)
2. Press `Code` button

3. Create codespace on main

4. This will create the container on GitHub. If it asks you to setup config, select the minimum possible CPU and RAM
5. Start it and leave it to finish. This could take a bit longer
6. Goto terminal in the browser version of the VSCode editor you're presented with. It should be at the bottom, or open it from the menu `Terminal -> New Terminal`
7. You can find the menu in the top left, with 3 lines icon

8. Install Rust by pasting these in the terminal:
  ```bash
  apt-get update && apt-get install fuse3
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```
  Press 1 and Enter on Rust installation, accepting all defaults.

  If installation aborts, then run these
  ```bash
    apt update
    apt install rustc
    rustc
  ```
9. Create a `tmp` folder, which we will use to copy files from our machine, by pasting this in the terminal:
  ```bash
  mkdir tmp && mkdir mnt && mkdir data
  ```
  
### Each resume and after the first setup

1. Open the [repo](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs)
2. Press `Code` button

3. Press ```...``` right to the instance in the list

#### VSCode in Browser

4. Press `Open in Browser`, or directly click on the container name

#### In local VSCode

Make sure you have VSCode installed locally, based on your OS.

4. Press `Open in Visual Studio Code`

#### Continue

Do step 11 from above.

5. Type this in the VSCode terminal, which will fetch the changes from the repo (if there are conflicts, accept Theirs):
  ```bash
  git pull
  git checkout --theirs .
  cargo run --release -- mount -m mnt -d data
  ```
6. Input a password and confirm it the first time

You can now perform two types of tests; see below. In both cases, follow these steps.

7. Copy files and folders from your local machine to `tmp` folder in VSCode
8. Copy files and folders from `tmp` to `mnt` and then do your operations the data in `nnt` folder
9. Make sure files were copied successfully by right-clicking a file and then `Download...` and save it to local machine and making sure it opens correctly

#### Exploratory testing

That is, testing anything that comes to mind.

Repeat steps 7-9 in various ways.

#### Test specific issues

Test specific issues from the [project](https://github.com/users/radumarias/projects/1). You can take the ones from `Ready for QA` column:
1. Assign the issue to you and move it to `In QA`
2. Test it
3. When you finished, move it to `Tested`

## Tests

I created some [files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N-2KhGNo7f23tQ9Si4yWa9dlFtxUnsoM?usp=sharing) to keep our tests until we migrate to browserstack or similar. 

- `test cases`: generic test cases
- `smoke tests`: short, small tests used to test a build quickly
- `acceptance`: tests that must be passed to consider a build stable. These we will run for prod builds

## Open a bug

Please use [this](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) and follow the steps in there.

## Creating a test case

Please add a new row in the `test cases` file and follow the template of the first row, for example. The same applies to smoke tests and acceptance tests.
