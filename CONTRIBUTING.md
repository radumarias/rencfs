3. **Ask the owner of the repository to add your GitHub username to the repository**
4. Pick an open issue or a task in the corresponding [project](https://github.com/users/radumarias/projects/1) for the repo that you'll be working on. You can see [good for first issues](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that you can pick from

6. Make the changes in your branch
7. Add docs as they apply
8. Add tests, benchmarks and examples for your changes, if applicable
9. `cargo fmt --all` to format the code. You can configure your `IDE` to do this on
