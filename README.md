An encrypted file system written in Rust that is mounted with FUSE on Linux. It can be used to create encrypted directories.

You can then safely back up the encrypted directory to an untrusted server without worrying about the data being exposed.
You can also store it in a cloud storage service like Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., and have it synced across multiple devices.

You can use it as CLI or as a library to build your custom FUSE implementation or other apps that work with encrypted data.

# GUI

There is a [GUI](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-desktop/blob/main/demo.gif) too.

# Motivation

Create a `simple,` `performant,` `modular` and `ergonomic` yet `very secure` `encrypted filesystem` to protect your `privacy`, which is also `open source` and is correctly and safely using `well-known audited` crates as `cryptographic primitives.`

# Key features

Some of these are still being worked on and marked with `[WIP]`.

- `Security` using well-known audited `AEAD` cryptography primitives;
- `[WIP]` `Data integrity`, data is written with `WAL` to ensure integrity even on crash or power loss;
- `[WIP]` Hide all info for enhanced `privacy`, all `metadata`, `content`, `file name`, `file size`, `*time` fields, `files count`, and directory structure is encrypted;
- `Safely` manage `credentials` in memory with `mlock(2)`, `mprotect`, `zeroize`, and `expiry` to mitigate cold boot attacks;
- `Memory safety`, `performance`, and `optimized` for `concurrency` with Rust;
- Simplicity;
- Encryption key generated from password;
- Password saved in OS's `keyring`;
- `Change password` without re-encrypting all data;
- `[WIP]` Generate `unique nonce` in `offline mode`;
- `Fast seek` on both reads and writes;
- `Writes in parallel`;
- Exposed with `FUSE`;
- Fully `concurrent` for all operations;
- `[WIP]` Handle `long file names`;
- `[WIP]` Abstraction layer for `Rust File` and `fs` API to use it as lib to `switch to using encrypted files` by just `changing the use statements`;
- `[WIP]` Abstraction layer to `access the storage` with implementations for desktop, Wasm, Android, and iOS and the ability to write your own implementation.

# Functionality

Some of these are still being worked on and marked with `[WIP]`.

- It keeps all `encrypted` data and `master encryption key` in a dedicated directory with files structured on `inodes` (with
  metadata info), files for binary content, and directories with files/directories entries. All data, metadata, and filenames
  are encrypted. It generates unique inodes for new files in a multi-instance run and offline mode.
- The password is collected from CLI and saved in the OS's `keyring` while the app runs. This is because, for security concerns, we
  clear the password from memory on inactivity, and we derive it again from the password just when needed.
- Master encryption key is also encrypted with another key derived from the password. This gives the ability to change
  the
  password without re-encrypting all data, we just `re-encrypt` the `master key`.
- Files are `encrypted` in `chunks` of `256KB`, so when making a change, we just re-encrypt that chunks.
- `Fast seek` on read and write, so if you're watching a movie, you can seek any position, and that would be instant.
  This is because we can seek a particular chunk.
- The encryption key is `zeroize` in the mem when disposing and idle. Also, it's `mlock`ed while used to prevent being moved to swap. It's
  also `mprotect`ed while not in use.
- `[WIP]` Ensure file integrity by saving each change to WAL, so for crashes or power loss, we apply the pending
changes at the next start. This makes the write operations atomic.
- Multiple writes in parallel to the same file, ideal for torrent-like applications.

## What separates us

[Asked](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e7a5a5-d254-8003-9359-9b1556b75fe9) ChatGPT if there are other solutions out there which offer all the key functionalities we do, seems like there are none :)  
You can see the [key features](README.md#key-features) that separate us.
  
# Usage

<!---
## Give it a quick try with Run on Google Cloud

[![Run on Google Cloud](https://deploy.cloud.run/button.svg)](https://deploy.cloud.run)
-->

## Give it a quick try with Docker

Get the image

```bash
docker pull xorio42/rencfs
```

Start a container to set up mount in it

```bash
docker run -it --device /dev/fuse --cap-add SYS_ADMIN --security-opt apparmor:unconfined xorio42/rencfs:latest /bin/sh
```

In the container, create mount and data directories

```bash
mkdir fsmnt && mkdir fsdata
```

Start `rencfs`

```bash
rencfs mount --mount-point fsmnt --data-dir fsdata
```

Enter a password for encryption.

Get the container ID

```bash
docker ps
```

In another terminal, attach to the running container with the above ID

```bash
docker exec -it <ID> /bin/sh
```

From here, you can play with it by creating files in `fsmnt` directory

```bash
cd fsmnt
mkdir 1
ls
echo "test" > 1/test
cat 1/test
```

## As a library

For the library, you can follow the [documentation](https://docs.rs/rencfs/latest/rencfs/).

## Command Line Tool

### Dependencies

To use the encrypted file system, you need to have FUSE installed on your system. You can install it by running the
following command (or based on your distribution).

Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -S fuse3
```

Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install fuse3
```

### Install from AUR

You can install the encrypted file system binary using the following command

```bash
yay -Syu && yay -S rencfs
```

### Install with cargo

You can install the encrypted file system binary using the following command

```bash
cargo install rencfs
```

### Usage

A basic example of how to use the encrypted file system is shown below

```
rencfs mount --mount-point MOUNT_POINT --data-dir DATA_DIR
```

- `MOUNT_POINT` act as a client, and mount FUSE at the given path
- `DATA_DIR` where to store the encrypted data
  with the sync provider. But it needs to be on the same filesystem as the data-dir

It will prompt you to enter a password to encrypt/decrypt the data.

### Change Password

The master encryption key is stored in a file and encrypted with a key derived from the password.
This offers the possibility to change the password without needing to re-encrypt the whole data. This is done by
decrypting the master key with the old password and re-encrypting it with the new password.

To change the password, you can run the following command

```bash
rencfs passwd --data-dir DATA_DIR 
```

`DATA_DIR` where the encrypted data is stored

It will prompt you to enter the old password and then the new password.

### Encryption info

You can specify the encryption algorithm by adding this argument to the command line

```bash
--cipher CIPHER ...
```

Where `CIPHER` is the encryption algorithm. You can check the available ciphers with `rencfs --help`.  
The default value is `ChaCha20Poly1305`.

### Log level

You can specify the log level by adding the `--log-level` argument to the command line. Possible
values: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO` (default), `WARN`, `ERROR`.

```bash
rencfs --log-level LEVEL ...
```

## Use it in Rust

You can see more [here](https://crates.io/crates/rencfs)

# Build from source

## Browser

If you want to give it a quick try and not setup anything locally you can  
[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs)

[![Open Rustlings On Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new/?repo=radumarias%2Frencfs&ref=main)

You can compile it, run it, and give it a quick try in the browser. After you start it from above

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install fuse3
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
mkdir mnt && mkdir data
cargo run --release -- mount -m mnt -d data
```

Open another terminal

```bash
cd mnt
mkdir a && cd a
echo "test" > test.txt
cat test.txt
```

## Locally

For now, the `FUSE` (`fuse3` crate) only works on `Linux`, so to start the project, you will need to be on Linux. 
Instead, you can [Develop inside a Container](#developing-inside-a-container), which will start a local Linux container, the IDE will connect to it, 
and you can build and start the app there and also use the terminal to test it.  
On Windows, you can start it in [WSL](https://harsimranmaan.medium.com/install-and-setup-rust-development-environment-on-wsl2-dccb4bf63700).

### Getting the sources

```bash
git clone git@github.com:radumarias/rencfs.git && cd rencfs
````

### Dependencies

#### Rust

To build from source, you need to have Rust installed, you can see more details on how to install
it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
````

Accordingly, it is customary for Rust developers to include this directory in their `PATH` environment variable.
During installation `rustup` will attempt to configure the `PATH`. Because of differences between platforms, command
shells,
and bugs in `rustup`, the modifications to `PATH` may not take effect until the console is restarted, or the user is
logged out, or it may not succeed at all.

If, after installation, running `rustc --version` in the console fails, this is the most likely reason.
In that case please add it to the `PATH` manually.

The project is set up to use the `nightly` toolchain in `rust-toolchain. tool`; on the first build, you will see it fetch the nightly.

Make sure to add this to your `$PATH` too

```bash
export PATH="$PATH::$HOME/.cargo/bin"
```

```bash
cargo install cargo-aur
cargo install cargo-generate-rpm
```

### Other dependencies

Also, these dependencies are required (or based on your distribution):

#### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -S fuse3 base-devel act
```

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install fuse3 build-essential act
```

#### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install fuse3 && dnf install @development-tools act
```

### Build for debug

```bash
cargo build
```

### Build release

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

```bash
cargo run --release -- mount --mount-point MOUNT_POINT --data-dir DATA_DIR
```

#### Dev settings

If you don't want to be prompted for a password, you can set this env var and run it like this:

```bash
RENCFS_PASSWORD=PASS cargo run --release -- mount --mount-point MOUNT_POINT --data-dir DATA_DIR
```

For dev mode it is recommended to run with `DEBUG` log level:

```bash
cargo run --release -- --log-level DEBUG mount --mount-point MOUNT_POINT --data-dir DATA_DIR
```

### Build local RPM for Fedora

This is using [cargo-generate-rpm](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-generate-rpm)

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate-rpm
cargo build --release
cargo generate-rpm
```

The generated RPM will be located here: `target/generate-rpm`.

#### Install and run local RPM

```bash
cd target/generate-rpm/
sudo dnf localinstall rencfs-xxx.x86_64.rpm
```

## Developing inside a Container

See here how to configure for [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/connect-to-devcontainer.html) and for [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

You can use the `.devcontainer` directory from the project to start a container with all the necessary tools to build
and run the app.

# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

The minimum supported version is `1.75`.

# Future

The plan is to implement it also on macOS and Windows
- **Systemd service** is being worked on [rencfs-daemon](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-daemon)
- **GUI** is being worked on [rencfs-desktop](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-desktop) and [rencfs-kotlin](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-kotlin)
- **Mobile apps** for **Android** and **iOS** are being worked on [rencfs-kotlin](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs-kotlin)

# Performance

`Aes256Gcm` is slightly faster than `ChaCha20Poly1305` by a factor of **1.28** on average. This is because of the hardware acceleration of AES 
on most CPUs via AES-NI. However, where hardware acceleration is not available, `ChaCha20Poly1305` is faster. Also `ChaChaPoly1305` is better at `SIMD`.

# Cipher comparison

## AES-GCM vs. ChaCha20-Poly1305

- If you have hardware acceleration (e.g. `AES-NI`), then `AES-GCM` provides better performance. On my benchmarks, it was
  faster by a factor of **1.28** on average.  
  If you do not have hardware acceleration, `AES-GCM` is either slower than `ChaCha20-Poly1305`, or it leaks your
  encryption
  keys in cache timing.
- `AES-GCM` can target multiple security levels (`128-bit`, `192-bit`, `256-bit`), whereas `ChaCha20-Poly1305` is only defined at
  the `256-bit` security level.
- Nonce size:
    - `AES-GCM`: Varies, but the standard is `96-bit` (`12 bytes`).
      If you supply a longer nonce, this gets hashed down to `16 bytes`.
    - `ChaCha20-Poly1305`: The standardized version uses `96-bit` nonce (`12 bytes`), but the original used `64-bit`
      nonce (`8 bytes`).
- Wear-out of a single (key, nonce) pair:
    - `AES-GCM`: Messages must be less than `2^32 – 2` blocks (a.k.a. `2^36 – 32 bytes`, a.k.a. `2^39 – 256-bit`), that's
      roughly `64GB`.
      This also makes the security analysis of `AES-GCM` with long nonces complicated since the hashed nonce doesn’t
      start
      with the lower `4 bytes` set to `00 00 00 02`.
    - `ChaCha20-Poly1305`: `ChaCha` has an internal counter (`32-bit` in the standardized IETF variant, `64-bit` in the
      original design). Max message length is `2^39 - 256-bit`, about `256GB`
- Neither algorithm is **nonce misuse-resistant**.
- `ChaChaPoly1305` is better at `SIMD`

### Conclusion

Both are good options. `AES-GCM` can be faster with **hardware support**, but **pure-software** implementations of
`ChaCha20-Poly1305` are almost always **fast** and **constant-time**.

# ⚠️ Security Warning: Hazmat!

- **Phantom reads**: Reading older content from a file is not possible. Data is written with WAL and periodically
  flushed to file. This ensures data integrity and maintains change order.
  One problem that may occur is if we do a truncation, we change the content of the file, but the process is killed before
  we write the metadata with the new file size. In this case, the next time we mount the system, we will still see the old
files. However, the content of the file could be bigger, and we read until the old size offset, so we would not
  pick up
  the new zeros bytes are written on truncating by increasing the size. If content is smaller, the read would stop and
  end-of-file of the actual content, so this would not be such a big issue
- **What kind of metadata does it leak**: None, we encrypt filename, content, and metadata and we hide file count, size, and all-time fields
- It's always recommended to use encrypted disks for at least your sensitive data; this project is not a replacement for
  that
- To reduce the risk of the encryption key being exposed from memory, it's recommended to disable memory dumps on the
  OS level. Please see [here](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/disable-core-dumps-in-linux-with-systemd-sysctl/) how to do
  it on Linux
- **Cold boot attacks**: to reduce the risk of this, we keep the encryption key in memory just as long as we really
  need it to encrypt/decrypt data, and we are zeroing it after that. We also remove it from memory after a period of
  inactivity
- Please note that no security expert audited this project. It's built with security in mind and tries to
  follow all the best practices, but it's not guaranteed to be secure
- **Also, please back up your data; the project is still in development, and there might be bugs that can lead to data
  loss**

# Considerations

- Please note that this project doesn't try to reinvent the wheel or be better than already proven implementations
- This project doesn't want to be a replacement in any way for already proven file encryption solutions. If you really
  want to be close to bulletproof solutions, then maybe this is not the ideal one for you. But is trying to offer a simple use
  of an encryption solution that should be used, taking into consideration all the security concerns from above
- It started as a learning project of Rust programming language, and I feel like I keep building more on it
- It's a fairly simple and standard implementation that tries to respect all security standards and correctly use secure and robust
  primitives so that it can be extended from this. Indeed, it doesn't have the maturity yet to "fight" other well-known
  implementations.
  But it can be a project from which others can learn or build upon, or why not for some to actually use it, keeping in
  mind all the above
