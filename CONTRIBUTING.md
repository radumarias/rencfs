## How to contribute

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **These steps are more particular to this repo but mainly apply to all repositories; change the specifics.**

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this project by you, as
defined in the Apache License shall be dual-licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

1. Join [slack](https://bit.ly/3UU1oXi) and join `#dev-beginners` channel
2. **Ask the owner of the repository to add your GitHub username to the repository** so that you can work on issues and
   be able to create your own branches and not need to fork the repo

# Devs & QA automation (which steps apply)

3. Become familiar with docs and code by reading the [ramp-up](docs/readme/Ramp-up.md) guide
4. Pick an open issue or a task in the corresponding [project](https://github.com/users/radumarias/projects/1) for the
   repo you'll work on. You can
   see [good for first issues](https://github.com/radumarias/rencfs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
   that you can pick from
5. **Assign the issues you are working on to you and move them to the corresponding status column as you progress
   . If the task is not an issue yet, convert it to an issue first**
6. Make the changes in your branch
7. Add docs as they apply
8. Add tests, benchmarks, and examples for your changes, if applicable
9. `cargo fmt --all` to format the code. You can configure your `IDE` to do this on
   save, [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rust/rustfmt.html)
   and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust#_formatting)
10. `cargo clippy --all --release` and fix any errors
11. **DON'T INCREASE THE VERSION NUMBER IN `Cargo.toml`, WE WILL DO THAT WHEN RELEASING**
12. Create a `git` `push hook` file in `.git/hooks/pre-push` with [pre-push](scripts/git-hooks/linux-macos/pre-push)
    content
    on `Linux` and `macOS`, and [pre-push](scripts/git-hooks/windows/pre-push) on `Windows`.
    Make it executable in Linux and macOS
    with `chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push` .This will run when you do `git push` and will make the push quite
    slow, but please give it time to complete as this helps to fix any issues locally and not rely just on
    running `ci` on GitHub when you create the PR
13. Commit the changes and include the `<title> <#ID>` of the GitHub issue in the message. This will make the commits visible in the context of the issue so we can clearly see a clean history of all changes
14. Push your changes, and if there are any errors, fix them before you push them
15. Create a `PR` back to the `parent` repo targeting the `main` branch with the title as the GitHub issue title, including `#ID`. Also, include the link to the GitHub issue in the description, saying like `Fix for <link>` for bugs or `Implementation for <link>` for features and others
16. Request review from owners of the repository by adding them to the `Reviewers` field
17. After you've created the PR, go to the GitHub issue, and in the mid-right of the page, press the gear icon from the below image, select `radumarias/rencfs`, then write the PR number and select it. This will link the two, and when the PR is merged, it will close the issue too

18. In the project, move the item to `In Code Review`
19. Monitor the checks (GitHub actions runs) and fix the code if they are failing
20. Respond to any comments
21. **DON'T MERGE THE PR YOURSELF. LEAVE THAT TO REPOSITORY OWNERS**
22. In the end, ideally, it will be merged into `main`
